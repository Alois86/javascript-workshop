!SLIDE
# Recap
* How did you like yesterday?
* Learned something?
* Any more questions?

!SLIDE
# What is it good for?
Well let me show you with some examples
.notes Introduce the clients and foster some discussion

!SLIDE
# Introduce Client A: Advertisment provider
* Time is money!
* Real time 1 round bidding system
* parrallel is king
* Project started in Node.js

.notes What is DNTX

!SLIDE
# Why we build for Client A on Node.js
* JSON APIs
* Lot of parallel requests
* ... in and out
* Not a lot of 'hard' business logic


!SLIDE
# Introduce Client B
* Move towards SOA
* Lots of Data to munch
* Quickly changing requirements
* 'Just and API'

!SLIDE
# Why we build for Client B on Node.js
* JSON API
* Dynamic of JS and JSON helps us a lot
* There were libraries for most of 'the hard parts'
* The alternative was PHP ;)

!SLIDE
# Introduce Client C
* Hotel booking system
* Lot of work is manual
* Serve a lot of 'static' pages

!SLIDE
# Why we didn't build on Node.js for Client C
* It's a complete website... the API is secoundary
* The busines logic is complex
* ActiveAdmin makes our work easier
* Classical CRUD App ++

!SLIDE
# Some lessons learned
* Check if the libs you need are available
* ... at least for the complex stuff
* be ready to patch where patches are needed!

!SLIDE
# Node.js projects in production...
* every project is different
* ecosystem changes quickly
* up to now breaking API changes were normal!

!SLIDE
# Server people don't know how to handle node.js, yet!
* Deployment is done by developers

!SLIDE
# Lot of Wheel Reinventing
...Especially around deployment

!SLIDE
# DISCUSS ;)
